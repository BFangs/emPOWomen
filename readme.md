## Introduction
This was our submission for the Girls in Tech, San Francisco, Hacking for Humanity hackathon. This hackathon aimed to innovate for social change for girls and women, by women, tackling relevant topics. We were inspired by how the cost of education can be a barrier to many women. Scholarships are advertised online, but in disparate locations and different scholarships are geared toward different groups and have different requirements. It can be difficult to find scholarships that are geared toward women and that fit a specific person. Our goal is to make it easy to find and remember to apply to everything available.

## Description
* Scrapes the web for scholarships for women.
* Allows users to create a profile and find scholarships that match them.
* Allows users to get complete information on a scholarships and save scholarships for later use.
* Sends email reminders to users before scholarship deadlines.
